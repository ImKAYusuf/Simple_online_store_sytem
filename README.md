# Simple_online_store_sytem
Implemented a Python-based object-oriented shopping cart system that simulates real-world e-commerce functionality. The project uses class inheritance to represent different product categories such as Groceries, Clothing, and Electronics, each with its own discount logic. A central ShoppingCart class manages item addition, quantity tracking, total price calculation (including category-based discounts), and stock reduction logic. Encapsulation is maintained using protected attributes, while polymorphism ensures flexible discount behavior across product types. This project demonstrates core OOP principles, including abstraction, method overriding, and class composition, and provides a modular, scalable structure for handling inventory and checkout operations in a retail environment.
